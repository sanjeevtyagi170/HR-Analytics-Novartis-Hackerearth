Data Prepartion
-> For Removing missing values i used Knn imputation in my dataset, I also used Mean encoding but didn't get fruitful results
-> Data Standardization using StandardScaler
-> Do not found any duplicates in the dataset
-> Then data is divided into TRAIN and TEST Sets

Algorithms
-> I started my quest with Linear regression (took care of multicolinearity with VIF) obviously as dataset demand regression followed by Lasso,Ridge and ElasticNet
but i couldnt get too much from Linear regression, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net

-> Shifted my mind towards Random forest , i do started getting some accuracy with RF but it stucked at one accuracy point even after Tuning
-> Then I decided to use XGboost with gave a quite higher accuracy than above mentioned algorithms but same problem it got stucked on one value 
   even after Tuning
-> Then i tried ensembling technique of voting regressor by combining the results of XGBOOST, RF, Linear reg, Elastic Net & SVR
-> After trying all these methods and tuning. At last, I tried Deep Learning to solve a regression problem
Only, Deep learning provide me the result which i wanted to be in top 50's
